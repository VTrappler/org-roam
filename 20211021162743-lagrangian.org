* Short definition

In an optimization paradigm, the Lagrangian appears as a modified
version of the objective function, which incorporate the constraints
directly in its formulation, in order to yield an *unconstrained*
optimisation problem

* Calculus of variations and physics
** Lagrangian and Action
In physics, the Lagrangian refers to
\begin{equation}
L(t, y(t), \dot{y}(t))= \text{Kinetic Energy} - \text{Potential Energy}
\end{equation}

It is an "instantaneous" quantity, and the *action* is
\begin{equation}
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L \,\mathrm{d}t = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(t, y(t), \dot{y}(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
and we wish to minimize it.
** Hamilton's principle
At optimality, the true path is *stationary*:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\delta S}{\delta y(t)} =0
\end{equation}

and this leads to the Euler-Lagrange Equations:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} - \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{y}}=0
\end{equation}
