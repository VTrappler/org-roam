Let us consider the following [[id:d64056c7-f969-484c-baf5-d5f2726ce4ba][Linear System]]:
$Ax = b$.

Let $\pi_A(W)$ be the $A$-[[id:86b28d90-52e6-4b84-ab83-e3a1c01d717e][orthogonal projector]] onto the subspace generated by the columns of $W$.
A solution $x$ can be decomposed as
\begin{equation}
x = (I_n - \pi_A(W)) x + \pi_A(W)x
\end{equation}
The projection matrix is $P = W(W^TAW)^{-1}W^TA$, so
\begin{equation}
\pi_A(W)x = Px =W(W^TAW)^{-1}W^TAx = W(W^TAW)^{-1}W^Tb
\end{equation}
so the second term does not need any inversion
The first term can be computed by solving another (hopefully simpler linear system):
\begin{equation}
A (I_n - \pi_A(W))\hat{x} = (I_n - \pi_A(W))^Tb
\end{equation}
