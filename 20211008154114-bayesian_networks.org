We can use directed graphs in order to represent probability distributions. cite:bishop_pattern_2006

* Simple example
The probability distribution
\begin{align}
p(a, b, c) &= p(c \mid a, b) p(a, b)\\
           &= p(c \mid a, b) p(b \mid a) p(a)
\end{align}
is represented as
[[xournalpp:images/probabilistic-graphical-model.xop.xopp][Example of graphical model]]
+ A node without parents indicates something with only the prior distribution ($a$)
+ An arrow indicates that the distribution of the pointed node depends on the tail of the arrow



* Repeated variables, plates
