* Manifold
  $M$ is said to be a topological Manifold of dimension $n$, if
  each of its point admits a open neighbourhood, and a
  homeomorphism from this neighborhood to the Euclidian $\mathbb{R}^n$
  \begin{equation}
\forall x \in M, \exists U_x, \phi_x: U_x \rightarrow \phi_x(U_x) \subset \mathbb{R}^n
\end{equation}
$(U_x, \phi_x)$ is a local chart of $M$.
An atlas is a family of local charts which cover the whole manifold $M$
