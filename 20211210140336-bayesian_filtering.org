We will tackle [[id:30f05970-bcf5-4fb2-b6d7-13fa4209e968][Data Assimilation]], thus filtering, in a pure probabilistic framework, using mainly [[id:8dcedd6a-85dc-4af5-afde-5936cef961d6][Bayesian Inference]].

Let $Y_k = \{y_k, \dot,y_0Â \}$ be the set of all past observations.
We are interested in the distribution of $p(x_k \mid Y_k)$

* Forecast step
We wish to compute the pdf $p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_k)$ based on $p(x_k \mid
Y_k)$. By introducing the transition probability $p(x_{k+1}\mid x_k)$,
we can write:
\begin{equation}
p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_k) = \int p(x_{k+1} \mid x_{k}) p(x_k \mid Y_k) \,\mathrm{d}x_k
\end{equation}
Generally, we can assume that (stochastic modelling of the dynamical system)
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = F(x_k, w_k)
\end{equation}
where $w_k$ is meant to be a white noise of density $p_W$.
The transition probability can be written as
\begin{equation}
p(x_{k+1} \mid x_k) = \int \delta(x_{k+1} - F(x_k, w_k)) p_W(w_k) \,\mathrm{w_k}
\end{equation}
thus
\begin{equation}
p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_k) = \int p(x_k \mid Y_k)\delta(x_{k+1} - F(x_k, w_k)) p_W(w_k) \,\mathrm{w_k} \,\mathrm{d}x_k
\end{equation}

Assuming that the noise is additive:
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = M(x_k) + w_k
\end{equation}
The convolution rewrites as
\begin{align}
p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_k) &= \int p_W(x_{k+1} - M(x_k))p(x_k \mid Y_k) \,\mathrm{d}x_k \\
 &= \int p(x_{k+1}  \mid x_k)p(x_k \mid Y_k) \,\mathrm{d}x_k
\end{align}
If the model error is null, we have
\begin{equation}
p_W(x_{k+1} - M(x_k)) = \delta(x_{k+1} - M(x_k))
\end{equation}
and
\begin{align}
p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_k) &= \int \delta(x_{k+1} - M(x_k))p(x_k \mid Y_k) \,\mathrm{d}x_k \\
&{=} \frac{1}{\det(M^{'} \circ M^{-1} (x_{k+1}))} p\left(M^{-1}(x_{k+1}) \mid Y_k\right)
\end{align}

* Analysis step
Let us assume that the observation equation is
\begin{equation}
y_k = H(x_k, v_k)
\end{equation}
Let us assimilate the observation using the forecast distribution $p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_k)$
\begin{equation}
p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_{k+1}) = p(x_{k+1} \mid y_{k+1},Y_{k}) = p(y_{k+1} \mid x_{k+1}, Y_k) \cdot \frac{p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_{k})}{p(y_{k+1} \mid Y_{k})}
\end{equation}
Moreover,
\begin{align}
p(y_{k+1} \mid Y_k) &= \int p(y_{k+1}, x_{k+1} \mid Y_k) \,\mathrm{d}x_{k+1} \\
&= \int p(y_{k+1}\mid x_{k+1}, Y_k) p(x_{k+1} \mid Y_k) \,\mathrm{d}x_{k+1}
\end{align}

If we assume the observation errors $v_k$ to be uncorrelated in time,
\begin{equation}
p(y_{k+1} \mid x_{k+1}, Y_k) = p(y_{k+1} \mid x_{k+1})
\end{equation}
