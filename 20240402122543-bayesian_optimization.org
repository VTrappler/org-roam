It usually refers to the use of [[id:e917a64a-41b6-4eac-a0b7-f4a6c0e6e239][Gaussian Processes]] for [[id:7d189b3c-3b68-46f9-9f21-5ff1b5d2372d][Optimization]] problems.
From this metamodel, an [[id:b4f7efb4-5894-46f4-a8ec-e34122443d86][Acquisition function]] is derived, which is used as a proxy that needs to be optimized in order to select the new point of evaluation, thus enriching the metamodel.
