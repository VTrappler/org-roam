The Cholesky decomposition is the factorization of an Hermitian ($A =
\bar{A^T}$), positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower
triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose.

Let $A$ be such a matrix, then there exists $L$ such that
\begin{equation}
A = L^* L
\end{equation}
 and $L$'s elements on the diagonal are real and positive.

 In the real case, $L$ is lower triangular, and $L$'s elements on the diagonal are positive.
\begin{equation}
A = L^T L
\end{equation}
