#+title: Rejection Sampling

* Rejection Sampling
Rejection Sampling is a [[id:4c2833a0-5351-4fba-b25e-4985acbd205f][sampling method]] based on a proposal
distribution $q(x)$, from which it is easier to sample. We have the
following assumptions:
+ $p_X(x) \leq M q(x)$ for $M < 0$
+ we are able to evaluate $p_X(x)$

* Algorithm

+ Generate a sample $x_i$ using $q$
+ Accept the sample $x_i$ with probability $\frac{p_X(x_i)}{Mq(x_i)}$

* Drawbacks

+ Finding a value $M$ valid 
+ Acceptance probability $\propto \frac{1}{M}$, so harder in higher
  dimensions when $M$ is large
