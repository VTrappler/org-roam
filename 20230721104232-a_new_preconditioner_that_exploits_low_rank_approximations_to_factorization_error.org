#+title: A new Preconditioner That Exploits Low-Rank Approximations to Factorization Error

We consider a [[id:d64056c7-f969-484c-baf5-d5f2726ce4ba][Linear System]] $Ax = b$ to solve with an Iterative Method.

Many [[id:a5dab6d7-fca6-418a-916a-2812720fb876][Preconditioners]] are based on an approximate LU factorization: $A = \hat{L}\hat{U} + \Delta A$, and use the approximate factors as $A^{-1}$

In the paper, the authors starts on the following observation:
 + Ill conditioned matrices usually have *a small number of small singular values*
 + The inverse of such matrices have then a *small number of large singular values*, hence are *Numerically Low Rank*

   The error matrix
\begin{equation}
 E = \hat{U}^{-1}\hat{L}^{-1} A - I = \hat{U}^{-1}\hat{L}^{-1} \Delta A \approx A^{-1} \Delta A
\end{equation}
can be expected to retain the numerically low-rank property of $A^{-1}$
