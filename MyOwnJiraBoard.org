*******  If there is information relevant to your application that we should be aware of, please include here
****** Applications Questions
******* Why are you enthusiastic about Machine Learning in Weather Forecasting?
	Recent advances in data driven modelling of earth system has
	shown that the latest architectures (such as GNN and
	transformers), and given enough data, can produce accurate
	weather predictions, for a fraction of the computational
	resources (excluding the training). This helps
	Taking into account the uncertainty is done more and more in regression tasks, as new tools emerge such as VAE, or BNN.

****** Responsabilities:
******* Apply machine learning models and techniques to support uncertainty quantification for the weather-induced extremes Digital Twin

****** Statement of Motivation:
*******  Please include a summary explaining why you are applying for this vacancy:
	ECMWF is a world leader in numerical weather predictions, and
	the Destination Earth has the potential to.  On the technical
	aspect, the technical challenges that are to be tackled to
	construct such a digital twin. Recently, ML based systems are
	able to produce fast and accurate predictions, compared to
	traditional NWP systems.
*******  Please outline how you meet the job criteria:
*******  If applicable, please include details of any scientific publication list here.
*******  If there is information relevant to your application that we should be aware of, please include here

****** Applications Questions:
******* Why are you enthusiastic about Uncertainty Quantification in Weather Forecasting?:
	I think that being able to take into account uncertainties,
	and thus having a probabilistic view of systems is crucial in
	many applications, especially for forecasts. Point estimates
	are useful but often represent only a central tendency:
	getting access to the whole predictive distributions carry
	much more information. But being able to accurately quantify
	the tails of the prediction distributions is not a trivial
	task, especially when the numbers of ensemble members is
	limited.


Moreover, in a climate change
	context, extreme events play an increasingly important role
	with high social and societal impact, which explains the need
	to be able to predict them.  Traditional uncertainty
	quantification tools are difficult to apply to geophysical
	problems, partly due to the complexity of the solvers, the
	dimensionality of the quantity of interest, but ML may bring
	new tools to tackle this kind of problems, as it did in other
	fields.

Ensemble members for instance allows to understand more closely which
	phenomenon are well predicted, or how some uncertainties are
	propagated through time.
	
******* How do your skills and experience meet our job criteria and help ECMWF meet its ML objectives?
	During my PhD, I worked on optimization under uncertainties,
	in order to get a point estimate which is robust (in some
	sense) to aleatoric external uncertainties, so I had the
	chance to familiarize myself with the field of Uncertainty
	Quantification in the general sense. From a computational
	point of view, all the code developed during the PhD was in
	Python, using Numpy and scikit-learn for Gaussian Processes.

	For my postdoc, 
	
******* Please provide a list of examples (preferably with links to code or publications) where you have applied ML methods within Earth System Science.
