#+title: Impact of non-smooth observation operators on Data Assimilation
#+filetags: :DataAssimilation:

Data Assimilation with discontinuous observation operators is relevant to many applications:
 * [[id:30f05970-bcf5-4fb2-b6d7-13fa4209e968][Data Assimilation]] of "all-sky" satellite radiance observations
 * Sea-ice modelling
 * Discontinuities in the parametrizations, or at least non-differentiable
