kNN is a classification algorithm. 
 * Training: There is no training per say, but rather the storing of
   the training set, with its associated label for each point

   
 * Classification: For a point to classify, we can compute its
   $k$-nearest neighbors (user-defined constant) based on some metric,
   and assign it the most common label
