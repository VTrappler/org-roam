* Short intro
[[id:b055093c-ed5e-4e0e-b285-458744821241][MCMC]] is a class of [[id:4c2833a0-5351-4fba-b25e-4985acbd205f][Sampling methods]] from a probability
xdistribution, which consists in creating a [[id:463a3501-d30d-4a4d-81b3-664ee6a2063e][Markov Chain]], whose
stationary distribution is the desired distribution.

This is particularly useful when trying to get samples from a
distribution, whose point evaluation is known up to a normalizing
constant.
