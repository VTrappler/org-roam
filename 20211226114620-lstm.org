A Long short-term memory is a special architecture of [[id:f73cda73-3c82-43f4-9636-b2e409682afd][RNN]].
It is based on 4 components:
 * Cell
 * Input Gate
 * Output Gate
 * Forget gate

The cell acts as registry, which remembers values over arbitrary time intervals, while the gate regulate the flow of information.
