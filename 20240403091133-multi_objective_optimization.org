Multiobjective [[id:7d189b3c-3b68-46f9-9f21-5ff1b5d2372d][Optimization]] aims at finding the Pareto-optimal
solution of a problem, or at least finding non-dominated objective
vectors as close as possible to the true underlying Pareto front,
creating a discrete approximation sometimes called a Pareto front
approximation.

* Notations
** Preorder
Let us consider the problem of multi objective minimization: Let $f(x) = (f_1(x),\dots,f_n(x))$
each one of those is a scalar function we want to minimize.
A point $y'=(y'_1,\dots,y'_n)$ is said to *dominate* another point $y=(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ if
\begin{equation}
\forall i, y'_i \leq y_i
\end{equation}
and we can write $y' \prec y$
In the search space, similar definition can be made:
$x'$ dominates another $x$ if
\begin{equation}
\forall i, f_i(x') \leq f_i(x)
\end{equation}
 and $x' \prec_{f} x$

 The set of non-dominated points $x$ is the *Pareto set*, and its image by $f$ is called the *Pareto front*
** Remarkable points
+ Nadir objective vector: $(\max f_1, \dots, \max f_n)$
+ Ideal objective vector: $(\min f_1, \dots, \min f_n)$
