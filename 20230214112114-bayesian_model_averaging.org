This can be used to quantify the uncertainty across different models.

* Model evidence
Let us consider a classical [[id:8dcedd6a-85dc-4af5-afde-5936cef961d6][Bayesian Inference]] problem:
\begin{equation}
p(\theta_i \mid y, M_i) = \frac{p(y\mid \theta_i, M_i)p(\theta_i \mid M_i)}{p(y \mid M_i)}
\end{equation}

  The Model evidence is given by
  \begin{equation}
p(y \mid M_i) = \int_{\theta} p(y, \mid \theta, M_i)p(\theta \mid M_i) \, \mathrm{d}\theta
\end{equation}

Based on these quantities,and by assigning some prior probabilities
for the models, we can compute posterior model probabilities:
\begin{equation}
p(M_i \mid y) \propto p(y\mid M_i)p(M_i)
\end{equation}
* Bayes' Factor
which can be used for computing the Bayes Factor, which compares the
expressivity of two models, comparing model $i$ and model $j$.

\begin{equation}
\text{BF}_{i,j} = \frac{p(M_i \mid y)}{p(M_j \mid y)}
\end{equation}

* BMA
  Finally, given a QoI, say $x$ (covariate, future observation, parameter)
  We can perform BMA in order to have a posterior distribution over all models:
  \begin{equation}
p(x \mid y) = \sum_{i} p(x \mid y, M_i)p(M_i\mid y)
\end{equation}
