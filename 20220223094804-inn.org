#+title: INN

Invertible Neural Networks are [[id:7a245cfe-dcaa-47d6-a318-5574fab3b7ac][Neural Networks]] which are bijective:
\begin{align}
x &\mapsto F_\theta(x)=y \\
y &\mapsto F^{-1}_\theta(y) = x
\end{align}
where $x$ and $y$ have the same dimension.
* Examples of INN
** i-ResNets
   invertible [[id:bfc9e8e6-312e-43ed-bd9e-e1de91b9dcda][Residual NN]] are invertible if for each residual layer,
   the increment has a Lipschitz constant smaller than 1 (Banach-fixed point theorem)
** Normalizing flows
   [[id:17383d23-7ad0-4b99-a99f-660cd2984878][Normalizing flows]] make the best use of a change of variable
   formula, by imposing some particular form of the Jacobian, in order
   to keep its determinant easily tractable.
