#+title:  MVaR

The MVaR is the Multidimensional Value at Risk, which is defined for[[id:dd3f58ae-558d-487b-9dd3-620c75c7f4f3][ Multi-Objective Optimization]] under uncertainties:

It maps a random variable to a non-dominated set of vectors in the outcome space that are dominated by a fraction $\alpha$ of all possible realization.
Each vector in the MVaR set correspond to an objective specification that a design will meet with probability $\geq \alpha$

For a given point $x$:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{MVaR}_{\alpha}\left[f(x, U)\right]=\mathrm{Pareto}\left(\{z\in \mathbb{R}^{M},\quad\mathbb{P}_U\left[f(x,U) \leq z\right] \geq \alpha\}\right)
\end{equation}
