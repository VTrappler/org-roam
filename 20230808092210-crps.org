The Continuous Rank Probability Score is a [[id:1d49d9ca-3c03-4244-a330-8c610172d8b8][Scoring Rule]].  Let $y$ be
observations, $X$ a random variable which represents the probabilistic
forecasting at that point, with $F$ its cdf.

The CRPS is computed as
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{CRPS}(F, y) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \left(F(x) - 1_{x \geq y}\right)^2\,\mathrm{d}x
\end{equation}
