#+title: Power Iteration method
#+filetags: :LinearAlgebra:

The Power Iteration (or power method) is an eigenvalue algorithm,
which gives the greatest eigenvalue and associated eigenvector.

* Pseudocode
  - Let $b_0$ be a starting vector
  - While not converged
    - Set $b_{k+1} = \frac{Ab_k}{\|Ab_k\|}$

 And it converges with geometric rate, with ratio $|\lambda_2 /
 \lambda_1|$ where $\lambda_2$ is the second largest eigenvalue.
