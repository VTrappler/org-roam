#+title: Impact of non-smooth observation operators on Data Assimilation

Data Assimilation with discontinuous observation operators is relevant to many applications:
 * data assimilation of "all-sky" satellite radiance observations
 * Sea-ice modelling
 * Discontinuities in the parametrizations, or at least non-differentiable
