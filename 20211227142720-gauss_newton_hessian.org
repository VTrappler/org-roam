Newton's method is a root finding/[[id:7d189b3c-3b68-46f9-9f21-5ff1b5d2372d][Optimization]] algorithm

* 1D Case

Let $f$ be a real function, twice differentiable, and let us consider
the problem of finding $f(x)=0$.
At step $k$, around a point $x_k$, we have
So the next point to be considered can be chosen so that the linear
approximation of $f$ at $x_k$ is equal to zero, so that

\begin{equation}
f(x_k + h) = f(x_k) + hf'(x_k) + o(h)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
0 = f(x_k) + (x_{k+1} - x_k) f'(x_k) 
\end{equation}
so
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}
\end{equation}

* ND case
At step $k$, around a point $x_k$, we have
\begin{equation}
f(x_k + (x_{k+1} - x_k)) \approx f(x_k) + \nabla f(x_k) (x_{k+1} - x_k)
\end{equation}
So
\begin{equation}
x_{k+1} = x_k - (\nabla f(x_k))^{-1} f(x_k)
\end{equation}


* Optimization
Let us now change the notation, so that we are minimizing a function $g: x\mapsto f(x)^T f(x)$ (Nonlinear least-squares)
We are then trying to find a root of $\nabla g$, so the iteration becomes
\begin{align}
x_{k+1} &= x_k - (\nabla^2 g(x_k))^{-1} \nabla g(x_k) \\
        &=x_k - \left(2(\nabla f(x))^T (\nabla f(x)) + \sum_i f^{''}_i(x)f_i(x)\right)^{-1} \left(2 (\nabla f(x))^T f(x))\right) \\
        &= x_k - \underbrace{\left((\nabla f(x))^T (\nabla f(x)) + \sum_i f^{''}_i(x)f_i(x)\right)^{-1}}_{H^{-1}} \nabla g(x_k)
\end{align}

* Quasi-Newton methods
Since the Hessian is difficult to get in practice, it is often replaced by an approximation $B_{k+1}$, which should satisfy the *quasi-newton condition*, or secant equation
\begin{equation}
B_{k+1} (x_{k+1} - x_k) = \nabla g(x_{k+1})- \nabla g(x_k)
\end{equation}
And we want $B_{k+1}$ to be positive definite.

* Gauss-Newton
See 
A more in-depth study of Gauss-Newton is introduced in [[id:6d779bf7-10b4-46d0-b9d2-b4c1e0c328c8][Approximate GN methods for non-linear least-square problems]]
The increment considered in the Gauss-Newton method is
\begin{align}
x_{k+1} &= x_k - \underbrace{2\left(\nabla f(x)^T \nabla f(x)\right)^{-1}}_{H_{GN}^{-1}} \nabla g(x_k)
\end{align}
