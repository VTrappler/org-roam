A SOM is a [[id:ee87a4bb-2518-4c38-bf15-77525e382003][Unsupervised]] [[id:c0b12568-1f49-4871-b9a5-604548a59a4e][Machine Learning]] technique used to produce a low-dimensional representation (see [[id:99cd54d1-bb93-4a2e-b6e2-ffb81fafa2e0][Dimension Reduction]]), while preserving the *topological structure of the data*

* Principle
In general, training the SOM means to represent the input space of dimension $p$ as a map space with dimension 2.
 * Input space: dimension $p$
 * Map space: composed of "nodes" or "neurons" arranged as hexagonal or rectangular grid (2D)
   * Each node has a "weight vector", which is the position of the node in the input space.
   * To each node corresponds a set of instances from the input data
   * The position of "nodes" in the map are important
     * neighbouring nodes have similar weight vector
     * contiguous neurons correspond to particular pattern

* Architecture
Depending on rectangular or hexagonal grid, the neighbourhood are not the same
