*  Householder transform
For a unit vector $v$, the Householder transformation $H$ is defined
as the reflection across the (hyper)plane given by its normal vector $v$:
\begin{equation}
H_v(x) = x - 2 \langle x, v \rangle v
\end{equation}
If it not normalized, it can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
H_v(x) = x - 2 \frac{\langle x, v \rangle}{\|v\|^2} v
\end{equation}

* Householder (reflection) matrix
  In terms of matrix, it can be expressed as
  \begin{equation}
 P_u = I - 2 vv^T
  \end{equation}
So that


$P_ux = x - 2 v (v^Tx)$
