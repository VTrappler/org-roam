The Primitive equations (atmospheric or oceanic) are obtained by considering the [[id:8a455d77-49ee-43a3-bcd7-33464b94c837][Navier-Stokes Equations]] with a few additional assumptions, specific to the system studied.

* Hydrostatic Balance
The vertical component of the pressure gradient must balance the gravitational force:

\begin{equation}
\rho g = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
Or, by introducing the *geopotential height* $\Phi=gz$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z} = -\frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}
\end{equation}

* Conservation equation
For a tracer $c$, ie a quantity which is conserved, the conservation equation is written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{U} c) = 0
\end{equation}

** Example: mass conservation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{U} \rho) = 0
\end{equation}


* Momentum equations
According to Newton's second law, we have

\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{\mathrm{D} \mathbf{U}}{\mathrm{D} t} = - \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} - \rho g + \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{U} + \mathrm{Friction}
\end{equation}
where $\nu \nabla^2 \mathb{U}$ represents the viscosity term.
