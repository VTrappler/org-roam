[[id:99cd54d1-bb93-4a2e-b6e2-ffb81fafa2e0][Dimension Reduction]] algorithms tend to fall in two categories:
 * Those who preserve distance structure over all samples ([[id:57ae6377-3b1d-4e27-8ec4-785ee6d6dc1b][PCA]])
 * Those who favor local distance over global distance

   
UMAP is based on three assumptions:
 * There exists a manifold on which the data would be uniformly distributed
 * This manifold is locally connected
 * The Main goal is to preserve the *topological* structure.
