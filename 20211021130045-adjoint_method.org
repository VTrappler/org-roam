* Perturbation theory
Let us define a function
\begin{equation}
x \mapsto J(x)= h(u(x), x)
\end{equation}
The state variable $x$ satisfy the state equation $F(u(x), x)=0$
 * $F$ is called the forward equation
 * A state variable $u$ is an "admissible" state vector and is a
   *physical* realization if $\exists x$ such that $F(u, x)=0$
 * 

* Lagrangian based

Another "proof" is based on the [[id:713b6a9f-24f1-4bf2-9dd9-92af579c3a35][Lagrangian]].
