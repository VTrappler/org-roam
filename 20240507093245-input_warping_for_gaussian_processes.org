#+title: Input Warping for Gaussian Processes
#+filetags: :BayesianOptimization:GP:

[[id:e917a64a-41b6-4eac-a0b7-f4a6c0e6e239][Gaussian Processes]] are powerful tools to model a large class of functions, but often the assumption of stationarity is a bit too much:
The covariance between two inputs is invariant to translation.
The authors propose to learn and use a bijective warping of the inputs  .
