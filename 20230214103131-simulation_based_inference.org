#+title: Simulation Based Inference


Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a class of methods that infer the
input parameters and unobservable latent variables in a simulator from
observational data. SBI is different from traditional statistical
inference or machine learning because simulators are typically not
differentiable and their likelihoods are intractable
